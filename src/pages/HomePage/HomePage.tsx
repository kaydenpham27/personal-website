                I'm Kien Pham, a Software Engineer at Nanoputian. I develop and
                monitor integration solutions across Workforce Management,
                Timesheets, Payroll, HRIS, and ERP ecosystem. Besides, I'm also
                responsible for building and improving the company's internal
                products. It seems like a boring job; however, I think I
                actually enjoy it! Building integrations is like solving ad-hoc
                communication problems for systems, and once you get them
                talking to each other, you tend to gain some sort of
                satisfaction and have some fun.

                My early passion in high school was doing Competitive
                Programming. Yes, if you are not familiar with the term, it's
                somewhat similar to Leetcode or SWE interview questions. I love
                the satisfaction after solving a problem, and this satisfaction
                gradually became a love for beautiful algorithms and techniques.
                Thinking back, I believe such an early exposure to a subset of
                Computer Science definitely lighten my curiosity to the boarder
                universe of Computer.

                I graduated with a bachelor of Computer Science from Queensland
                University of Technology, where I spent a few semester working
                as a research assistant. After graduating, I used to have the
                thought of doing a PhD or Master in Quantum Computing or
                Computer Science but unfortunately, this plan is cancled or
                postponed to the far future. There are things that I need to do
                first.

                various aspects of life, expect to see reviews on books,

                me, discussions on Computer Science topics, and maybe beautiful
                images.
